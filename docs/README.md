# Welcome to the CIZEN TECH Technical Support page.

CIZEN TECH consists of imaging science, computer science, and electrical engineers with over 10 years of experience in camera module testing.  
CIZEN TECH's accumulated FPGA programming, device power supply and measurement analog circuit design technologies have become the basis for developing a frame grabber to bring up the camera module and capture the output signal of camera module.  
CIZEN TECH's accumulated S/W technology has become the basis for the development of C/C++, C\#, and Python SDKs that support Windows and Linux operating systems, enabling frame grabber to be conveniently used in various industrial fields.  
CIZEN TECH's accumulated MTF measurement and image quality testing technologies have been combined with GPU parallel processing technology and AI-based image defect detection technology to form the basis for the development of the highest-performance image quality testing S/W.  
CIZEN TECH continues its efforts to develop the best technology by combining developed H/W and S/W technologies with the latest technologies.
